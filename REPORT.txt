After a long research, I decided to go ahead with rawg.io, as it looked the most complete database, and its API was easy to get. It includes more than 500,000 games, has tags to define each game (this was crucial) and includes phone games, which was an important point to me to make the app also useful for elder people who have access to a smartphone.

Other sites I have considered:
XXXX (advantages/disadvantages).

Connecting the app to the app was easy enough and, until we build the user profiles to match them with games, I wanted the app to show a random game on refresh, which is being a hard process as the API is complex to me at this moment, and I'm trying to find out how to generate this random number between 1 and the maximum amount of games.
